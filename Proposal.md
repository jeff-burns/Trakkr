## Trakkr Proposal

## Project Description
* Trakkr is a native app that is an emergency alert application. It allows the user to click a button and send out text messages to multiple phone numbers and also send their location if they are in danger. There will be three different levels of alerts that the user can send out. The app will automatically text 911 with the top two levels of alerts. 

## Problem statement
* There are too many instances when people are in danger and do not have time to dial a number or queue a text to send to someone. This app will enable people to send a mass text in a matter of seconds. This app will benefit everyone. 

## How will your project solve this problem?
* This app will allow the user to send out a mass, emergency text that will alert the people they choose to their current situation and allow them to see the users location and get help. The more people that are aware of the problem, the better the chance of getting help faster. 

## Map the user experience
* Users will open the app and be prompted to setup their app. They will be asked to confirm their phone number and also set up their preset messages for each level of emergency. Then they will enter the numbers they want those messages to be sent to (911 will be automatically texted on level 2 and 3 emergencies). When it is all set up, there will be three buttons on the home screen for each level of emergency. The app will look insignificant and not like an emergency alert in order to provide descrestion for users if they are in a situation where they need to be discreet. 

## What technologies do you plan to use?
* I will use React-Native for the front end and also bring in the Twilio library and the Google Maps API. I will use Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex for the backend. I will use Cypress and Nightwatch.js for testing.
